# Bio Page Application

## Description

This application was created to list some of my interests in one place so people can get to know me a little. I wanted to practice using HTML, CSS, and the Git Flow so I decided to do so by creating this simple page. I learned more CSS properties and got a better feeling for the Git Flow during the process. I of course hit some bugs along the way and learned the importance of timeboxing while toubleshooting. The Public Forums on Stack Overflow tremendously helped with de-bugging. Specifically when I had trouble merging branches on GitHub through the Terminal.

## Usage

This website can be used as a way to share my interests with others. Since this is more for personal use, I added a link to my Facebook profile at the end as well.
